# PHP Data Types

PHP is called a weakly typed or dynamically typed language. In PHP, the *type* of a variable is determined by the value assigned to it.

PHP supports the following basic data types:

- **Integer**. Used for whole numbers
- **Float** (also called double). Used for real numbers
- **String**. Used for strings of characters
- **Boolean**. Used for `true` or `false` values
- **Array**. Used to store multiple data items
- **Object**. Used for storing instances of classes

Special types:

- **NULL**. Variables that have not been given a value, have been unset, or have been given the specific
value `NULL`
- **resource**. Certain built-in functions (such as database functions) return variables that have the type
resource. They represent external resources (such as database connections)
**callable***. This is essentially a function that is passed to other function.
